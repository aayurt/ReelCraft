## Suggested Questions
_Questions this graph is uniquely positioned to answer:_

- **Why does `GET()` connect `Community 0` to `Community 2`?**
  _High betweenness centrality (0.006) - this node is a cross-community bridge._
- **What connects `GeminiWebService`, `QwenAutomate`, `VideoForge` to the rest of the system?**
  _4 weakly-connected nodes found - possible documentation gaps or missing edges._
